# CS340-Client-Server-Development
* ### How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 
  *Consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two.* 
  * To ensure my programs are maintainable, I focus on creating reusable functions. This allows me to call the same function in different parts of my code without rewriting it, reducing redundancy and improving efficiency. In the project we completed for this class, I created a .py file that contained all of my functions.
  * Keeping all functional code in a separate Python file made the main codebase much more readable. This file housed the create, read, update, and delete functions, as well as the code for object constructors used in CRUD operations.
  * One of the benefits of organizing code this way is that it becomes more adaptable. I was able to import the same crud.py module into different programs and run the operations without any issues.   

* ### What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
  * The primary advantage of creating a crud.py module was its reusability. Even as the main program changed, the database remained the same, allowing for use of the same module throughout. Making updates in the main code was straightforward and only required a function call to implement the desired operation.
  * In our project, only the create method was used. In the future, if I want to use the other CRUD methods, I would simply update the main code to incorporate their functionality. I could also build a completely new program to interface with the same database and use the CRUD functions as needed.
    
* ### How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? 
  *Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested.*
  * My approach starts with fully understanding the problem before writing any code. I begin by carefully reading the client’s requirements to get a clear sense of what they need. I then break the problem into smaller, more manageable pieces, identifying the necessary inputs and expected outputs. Understanding the data structure is crucial, as it informs how to extract and process the required information. I develop solutions to each smaller piece of the problem and integrate them into a complete program that addresses the original challenge. I test the code with print statements and sample data to ensure it works as expected. Finally, I clean up any unused code or print statements to maintain a neat and readable final product.
 
* ### How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
  * My overall approach to this project was consistent with my previous assignments, but I did need to learn more about MongoDB and NoSQL databases since I had limited prior experience with them. This project gave me valuable insight into working with non-relational databases, and I now feel more confident tackling similar tasks in the future. Going forward, I would apply strategies such as clearly defining data models, normalizing data where appropriate, and creating modular code to handle database operations. These practices will help me efficiently meet client needs in future projects.

* ### What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
  *  In the context of this project, computer scientists use their skills to develop practical solutions to real-world problems. Databases often contain vast amounts of data, much of which may not be relevant to a specific task. A computer scientist’s role is to efficiently extract and format the right data so that it becomes useful and actionable.
  *  For a company like Grazioso Salvare, this kind of work significantly improves efficiency. Instead of manually combing through large datasets, the company can rely on automated tools to quickly find the animals or data points that meet specific criteria. This reduces the time and resources needed to identify the right specimens, ultimately helping the company focus more on its core mission.
